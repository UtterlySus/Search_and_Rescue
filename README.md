Welcome to our project!

please follow the below steps to execute the simulation correctly:

1- unzip the compressed file in https://files.fm/u/8qwbk26ss

1.1- copy all the folders inside ROS_Files to cd ~/catkin_ws/src

2- now go back to root folder by "cd ~/catkin_ws/" in terminal

3- compile and build the packeges "catkin_make" in terminal

if you see 100% completed then everything is good!

4- now we need to source catkin_ws by typing "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" in terminal

5- open a new terminal and execute "roslaunch hector_quadrotor_demo two_drones_desert.launch"

the simulation will start after this, thanks!
